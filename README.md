# Teamcity Wrapper

This library features a PHPUnit runner for TeamCity. It makes use of
TeamCity service messages to report unit test results directly to
TeamCity.

This library is an update to original library from Maarten Balliauws
[phpunit-runner-teamcity](https://github.com/maartenba/phpunit-runner-teamcity)
adapted to work with the PHPUnit 6+.
